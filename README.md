* [adaboost.py](https://github.com/xiaeryu/Machine-Learning/blob/master/adaboost.py): adaboost with Python


* [linearRegression.py](https://github.com/xiaeryu/Machine-Learning/blob/master/linearRegression.py): linear regression with Python.  
 Included are: standard linear regression, local weight linear regression, ridge regression, and the forward stagewise regression.


* [regTree.py](https://github.com/xiaeryu/Machine-Learning/blob/master/regTree.py): regression tree with Python  
 Mainly discussed tree-based regression, the CART algorithm. Included are regressoin trees and model trees.
